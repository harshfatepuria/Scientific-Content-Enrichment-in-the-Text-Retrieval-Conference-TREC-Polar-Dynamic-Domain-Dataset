These improvements result from more refined estimates of time lags for different sensor outputs, changes in low-pass filtering, a new static pressure port calibration, and a new GPS unit. The primary motivation for this was: (1) the use of circular flight patterns for turbulence measurements which results in more stringent accuracy requirements in some instruments because of the large variation in output around a circle; and (2) the observation in EPIC and DYCOMS-II that the turbulent momentum flux vector in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) was modulated by aircraft heading."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Highrate,Wind,Gust,Measurements,from,the,NCAR,C130,Aircraft", "filePath": "edu/ucar/eol/www/71F8FA911CFC79D653FA2B276D233676335D323CDD63A044C899E53A5FA19429"}}
