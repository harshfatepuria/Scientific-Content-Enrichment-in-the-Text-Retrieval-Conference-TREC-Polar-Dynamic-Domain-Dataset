There were a number of staff changes and the project was placed on a more permanent basis. The original contract between JSTOR and the UC Libraries was completed, and negotiations for a second contract of new titles to be added to the archive were begun. In the 2005/2006 year it had been realized that due to frequent turnover of student employees, the Project was not able to maintain a consistent number of staff hours from month-to-month and the productivity goals weren't being consistently met to complete the project on schedule. To resolve the staff problem, temporary staff from Library Associates was brought in to supplement and later to replace most of the student assistants. In 2006/2007 the number of temporary personnel was increased to eight people working 35 hours a week. This increased the potential of the staff to validate over 700,000 pages a month. Then during the summer of 2006, the Project lost two key staff members. In June, LAIII Student Supervisor Kris Brix resigned, followed in August by the resignation of Project Manager Jeff Sundquist, who left to continue his post graduate education at UC Berkeley. SRLF Director, Colleen Carlton, acted quickly by temporarily reclassifying SRLF staff member John Doing to serve as the Project Manager. Shortly thereafter, Jana Courter was hired to fill the vacant LAIII position. In response to the new emphasis on temporary staff and the change in management, a new system for recording and compiling validating statistics was created and put into place. This allowed staff to record their statistics using online forms, and allowed the LA III to compile the statistics into an online spread sheet, eliminating much tedious manual addition and paper statistical computation. This allowed JSTOR project staff to more easily and more quickly compile statistics and give more immediate feedback on the state of the project. The original contract had called for completion by December 31, 2006, but with the slow start due to the necessity to set up the initial procedures for the project, the high rejection rate of materials donated, and the turnover of student staff during 2005/06, this completion date became less and less feasible. With the decision to shift from primarily student employees to temporary agency staff a more realistic completion date was determined to be April of 2007. An amendment to the original contract was agreed upon by UC and JSTOR to move the end date of the contract to April 30, 2007. During this period JSTOR and UC also began negotiations for a Phase 2 contract with a new list of over 500 journal titles in approximately 15,000,000 pages of content to be reviewed, validated and moved into the archive.
