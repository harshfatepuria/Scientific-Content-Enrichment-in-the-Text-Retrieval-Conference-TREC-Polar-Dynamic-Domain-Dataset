Course reductions assume that faculty continue to fulfill all other instructional, advising, service, and research responsibilities. UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA POLICY Two University of Arizona policies allow specifically for course reductions. The conditions under which each is applicable varies by circumstance. See UHAP 8.05.01 for information on TADA (Temporary Alternative Duty Assignment) and UHAP 8.04.06 for information on the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act Of 1993. COLLEGE OF SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES POLICY In addition to options per the above University of Arizona policies, the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences also offers the following two alternatives for course reductions: PRIOR ARRANGEMENT Faculty anticipating a need for course reduction in an upcoming semester may arrange with the department Head/Director to teach an additional course or courses in the semester(s) leading up to the semester in which the course reduction is to be taken. In the case of such arrangements, the agreement must be signed by both the faculty member and the Head/Director, with a memo outlining the agreement sent to the Dean's office (though Dean's approval is not required for such arrangements). COURSE BUY OUT Course buyouts require advanced prior approval from both the department Head/Director and the Dean. Faculty may temporarily reduce their salaries in order to \" buy out \" a course or courses in a given semester, while continuing to fulfill all other instructional, advising, service, and research responsibilities. The total amount of funds required to buy out a single course is 10% of current salary. In the case of course buy out arrangements, the agreement must be signed by both the faculty member and the Head/Director, with a memo outlining the agreement sent to the Dean's office for approval."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Policy,title,COURSE,REDUCTION,OPTIONS", "filePath": "edu/arizona/sbs/web/32356775F0CF2D298149CD38E5CBE9B1C7E85D90843C19EC73EC345818A2F332"}}
