Understanding societal risks and vulnerabilities to weather hazards and climate change requires interdisciplinary approach, that includes information about weather, climate, natural and built environment and social processes and characteristics. Climate-and weather-related policy and decision-making largely depend on usability of earth system science output and accessibility of data. The NCAR\u02bcs Geographic Information Systems (GIS) program has been working towards integrating the Earth system and social sciences through spatial analysis and interoperability of georeferenced information, and towards improving usable science and knowledge sharing between science groups, educators and stakeholders. Recent advances in GIS science and technology and developments in the interoperability standards provide opportunities for innovative coupling of geo-and social sciences data and model outputs in GIS systems. This presentation will provide an overview of NCAR GIS program and discuss research directions for integration of geo-and social sciences in the context of extreme weather events and climate change. Challenges and opportunities in conducting interdisciplinary spatial research at various scales of analysis will be discussed. The presentation will also include a case study that explores linkages between quantitative and qualitative data for a more comprehensive understanding of local-level vulnerability and adaptive capacity to extreme heat in urban settings. A methodology for integration of household surveys, collected in Phoenix, Arizona into a quantitative spatial assessment of societal vulnerability will be discussed."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Advanced,Study,Program,Seminar,Bridging,social,and,geosciences,data,with,GIS", "filePath": "edu/ucar/asp/www/D62C14F095771AF4596DF6F5BEE241CE5FE7BA6C65ECC824F8DCF4C1E116CEAE"}}
