Collect very small young leaves from the shoot tips of a healthy plant. Avoid collecting during a heat wave. The three leaves closest to the shoot tip are best. The younger the better. Collect enough leaves to cover the blotting paper without overlapping the leaves. 2. Place the leaves in an envelope between the two sheets of blotting paper. Keep the leaves flat. Do not overlap the leaves. 3. Place one silica gel packet in the envelope between the blotting paper and the inside surface of the envelope, i.e. not between the sheets of blotting paper with the leaves. 4.
