Results are available for trials from two seasons with high elevation plant materials. This selection shows broad promise due to its productivity and fruit quality and will be considered for released in 2015. All plant material for the trials reported here was propagated at a high elevation nursery near Macdoel, CA. Planting stock for Watsonville trials was harvested from Macdoel on October 15-16 and planted November 2-5. In both years, fruit harvesting was conducted through October 15. CN236 has greater total productivity than, and a similar production pattern to, the comparison cultivars (Table 1). Plants for CN236 are larger than for Albion but smaller than for Monterey or San Andreas. CN236 produces fewer runners in the fruiting field than does Albion, more than San Andreas. CN236 has appearance scores and cull percentages similar to or superior to the comparison cultivars. Fruit size for CN236 was also similar to the comparison cultivars. Fruit for CN236 is slightly firmer than Albion. Importantly, the subjective evaluations of flavor and post-harvest storage capacity were excellent for CN236. C229 fruit has slightly lighter fruit color than Albion."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "UC,Strawberry,Bulletin,20143,Performance,of,dayneutral,selection,CN236,81811,at,the,Watsonville,Strawberry,Research,Facility,in,20122013", "filePath": "edu/ucdavis/plantsciences/www/1F46B161600FF08C038A6C132A9F6D0A62E783BF681D67B45BB396834DF688C0"}}
