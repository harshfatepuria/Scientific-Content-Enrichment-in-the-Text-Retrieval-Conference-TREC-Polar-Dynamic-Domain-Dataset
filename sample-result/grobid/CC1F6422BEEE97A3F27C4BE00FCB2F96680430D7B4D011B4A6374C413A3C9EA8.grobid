Overarching questions include (1) How will global change alter the futures of regional social-ecological systems? (2) How and why do regional social-ecological systems differ in vulnerability, resilience and adaptability to global change? Such questions cannot be addressed by discipline-bound thinking, require new approaches, and must be answered through broad-scale comparative investigations of dissimilar systems. Scenario thinking is among the most promising approaches to emerge (e.g. the 2005 Millennium Assessment). Scenarios begin as suites of qualitative narratives\u2014developed by regional stakeholders including social and ecological scientists\u2014that describe an envelope of plausible futures based on contrasting assumptions. The narratives inform and are, in turn, informed by integrated spatial models of socio-ecological change (e.g. agent-based models or linked land change, econometric, and ecosystem models). This approach for coupling qualitative and quantitative scenarios has informed planning and policy and generated a rich set of fundamental research questions. Our overarching questions evoke a host of specific research questions, including: 1. How does the connectivity of social and ecological systems change over time and space, and what are the consequences of connection strength for change? 2. Are social-ecosystems more vulnerable or resilient to press versus pulse disturbances, and do these responses vary across ecosystem types? Do human societies display greater adaptability to press versus pulse disturbances? 3. What ecological and social factors affect the characteristics of thresholds where cumulative small effects trigger large changes in system? 4. What are the unintended consequences of optimizing particular structures or processes of social-ecological systems? 5. How are adaptive behaviors, perceptions of risk, and decision making influenced by policies and institutions, and what is the potential for those institutions to influence resilience of socio-ecological systems? Addressing these questions in a scenario framework is an effective way to achieve the research goals set out by the ISSE, which lack a cogent protocol. Approach To advance a broad comparative analysis of these critical questions requires an integrated network of sites distributed across a contrasting array of physical, biological, and cultural environments and characterized by extraordinary ability to collect, analyze, and synthesize diverse data. The core strengths of the LTER network \u2013 its history of long-term, place-based studies, its commitment to integrative research across disciplines , and its diversity of landscapes, stakeholders, and disturbance regimes \u2013 make it ideally suited to address these questions. Accordingly, we propose a network of scenario analyses to address and expand theories of social-ecological change, vulnerability, resilience and adaptability. Our proposed activity would operate through two simultaneous coupled activities: (1) the production of qualitative, stakeholder-driven narratives at all participating sites, and (2) quantitative socio-ecological landscape-change modeling across a focused set of site clusters to address the consequences of land use/urbanization and environmental change on critical ecosystem services, including carbon sequestra-tion, water availability and regional to national habitat quality and continuity. The integrated modeling would engage and contrast results across clusters of sites that share common problem space (e.g., similar biomes, land use issues, stakeholder groups, etc.) and would complement existing regional efforts."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "FUTURE,SCENARIOS,LANDSCAPE,VULNERABILITY,AND,RESILIENCE,TO,CLIMATE,AND,LAND,USE,CHANGE", "filePath": "edu/lternet/intranet2/CC1F6422BEEE97A3F27C4BE00FCB2F96680430D7B4D011B4A6374C413A3C9EA8"}}
