Veering is important for setting the stage for severe weather. As winds change, they also allow for rotation in the storm (mesocyclone). Varying strengths and configurations of the vertical wind profile and resulting shear determine the nature of the storms that form, whether they are single cells, multicells or supercells. An interesting tool used for looking at wind shear is the hodograph. The hodograph plots out the wind speed and direction at various heights and overlays them on one chart. At each point labeled by a number representing the height above ground level, the distance between that point and the origin indicates the speed. An arrow drawn pointing from the origin to the point on the hodograph would give you the direction of the wind. Assuming that the top of the page is labeled 180\u00b0, an arrow pointing up would be from the south (pointing to the label 180\u00b0) and an arrow pointing to the right would indicate a westerly wind (pointing to a label of 270\u00b0). (See Figure 2.) As in the hodographs on the following page, each level can be plotted and the dots connected. This traces the shearing with height. A line tangent to the curve represents the wind shear vector. The shear vector is the difference in the wind vector between two different heights. Both the wind and the shear vector may change with height, either veering or backing. The total shear is the length of the hodograph and the mean shear is the vector difference between two points.
