However, atmospheric conditions such as rain, ice or hot temperatures may cause an increase in required runway length. RAF Flight Operations may approve shorter runway operations on a case by case basis. 3.2 Operational Limits Investigators should consult with the RAF project manager for planning research flights. The RAF project manager will work with RAF flight operations group to help analyze the specific conditions required by the research mission. The range and altitude capabilities are significantly affected by payload weights, flight maneuvers required, and departures from standard atmospheric conditions. The GV aircraft is certified to the FAA's Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Parts 25 and 26. The aircraft carries Civil Registration Number N677F and a standard airworthiness certificate (FAA Form 8100-2) in the transport category. RAF operates the aircraft per FAR Part 91. 4.2 Crew Duty Limitations Crew duty limitations apply not only to EOL staff (flight crew, maintenance and technician personnel, instrument operators, etc.) but also to any other persons flying on board NSF/NCAR aircraft. Research personnel participating on flights should abide by the duty limitations specified. These limitations have been established to prevent crew fatigue from becoming a safety concern during flight operations. Thus, specific project flight schedules may necessitate additional staffing in order to meet the crew duty limitation requirements specified. The crew duty limits for a single crew are outlined in Table 4.1."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Chapter,3,GV,Performance,and,Flight,Planning,Guidelines,31,Runway,Requirements,Chapter,4,Flight,Operations,41,Aircraft,Certification,Overview", "filePath": "edu/ucar/eol/www/FC8BD7F84371859E05897FE682CF0D7FF9D80420228AD30A70FD60B19D052004"}}
