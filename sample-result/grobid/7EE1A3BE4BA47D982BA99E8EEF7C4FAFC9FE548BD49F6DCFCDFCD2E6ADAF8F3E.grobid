Model output statistics (MOS), perfect prog (PPM) or classical data processing approaches can be combined with statistical methods such as regression, discriminant analysis, or tree-based methods to generate a set of predictive equations. Statisical interpretation methods may also be classified as \"static\", where equations are developed and applied to independent data without change, or \"dynamic\", where equations are redeveloped on a regular basis using updated training datasets. Dynamic methods arose because frequent changes to the driving NWP models required more frequent updating of the statistical relationships, and include methods such as Updateable MOS and the Kalman Filter. These various statistical interpretation methods will be discussed in terms of their advantages and disadvantages for operational post-processing of NWP output, and examples will be shown. The survey will conclude with a discussion of new methods being developed for the post-processing of ensemble forecasts."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "NCAR,Statistical,interpretation,of,NWP,model,output,A,survey,of,methods,The,RAL,Seminar,Series", "filePath": "edu/ucar/ral/7EE1A3BE4BA47D982BA99E8EEF7C4FAFC9FE548BD49F6DCFCDFCD2E6ADAF8F3E"}}
