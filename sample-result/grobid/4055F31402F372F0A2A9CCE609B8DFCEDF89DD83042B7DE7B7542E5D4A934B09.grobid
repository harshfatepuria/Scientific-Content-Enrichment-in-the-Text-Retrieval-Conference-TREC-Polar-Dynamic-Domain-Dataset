Over the Sahel, they modulate the occurrence of intense mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) which are important to the hydrology of the region but can also result in flooding. Using data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and two ground-based radars in the Sahel, the modulation of convection by AEWs is examined. The focus of this is on how the vertical structure of convection, its intensity, and precipitation system size vary as a function of AEW phase. These results will be contrasted with differences in CAPE, shear, and moisture as a function of AEW phase. Lastly, the relationship between particularly intense MCSs and the northern low-level structure of AEWs will be illustrated. Intense MCSs are often found in the northwest sector of the middle-tropospheric AEW trough. In most of these situations, the AEW trough will be coupled to a cyclone to the northwest\u2014near the lower-tropospheric frontal zone south of the Sahara. Although the middle-tropospheric northerlies west of the AEW trough are dry, the northern cyclones are associated with a westerly jet. This lower-tropospheric westerly jet provides warm moist air and high shear to the northwest sector of the AEW trough, which supports MCS development."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "NCAR,Modulation,of,Moist,Convection,by,African,Easterly,Waves,The,RAL,Seminar,Series", "filePath": "edu/ucar/rap/www/4055F31402F372F0A2A9CCE609B8DFCEDF89DD83042B7DE7B7542E5D4A934B09"}}
