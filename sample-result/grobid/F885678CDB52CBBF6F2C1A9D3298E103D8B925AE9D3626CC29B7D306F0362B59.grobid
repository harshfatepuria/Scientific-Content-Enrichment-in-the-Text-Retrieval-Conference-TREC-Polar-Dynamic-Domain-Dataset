Successful candidates will conduct research to advance the sciences in numerical modeling, data assimilation, numerical prediction, and predictability on one of the following topics: (1) Advancing the modeling and prediction of hurricanes through assimilation of vortex-scale hurricane observations using advanced ensemble-based/variational/hybrid data assimilation method. (2) Advancing the modeling and prediction of severe convective storms to increase severe thunderstorm, flash flood and tornado warning lead times through assimilation of radar and other convective and meso-scale observations using advanced ensemble-based/variational/hybrid data assimilation method. (3) Advancing the assimilation of un-precedent observations onboard vessels in addition to other conventional and satellite observations, which will lead to the advancement of eventual coupled atmosphere-ocean modeling, prediction and data assimilation. Desired Qualification: \uf0b7 Education and Experience: \uf0fc Ph.D. in Atmospheric Science, Meteorology, Engineering, Computer Sciences, Physics, Mathematics or related disciplines \uf0fc Experience in numerical modeling \uf0b7 Skills and Proficiencies: \uf0fc Demonstrated ability to work independently and collaboratively \uf0fc Excellent written and oral communication skills \uf0fc Fortran 90/95 programming experience in UNIX/LINUX environment \uf0fc Familiarity with scripting and plotting languages In addition to work with a leading, vibrant and productive team, the successful candidates will work in the National Weather Center where School of Meteorology resides. National Weather Center houses the University's academic and research programs in meteorology, state organizations, and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Norman-based weather research and operational programs. Such academic and working environment will provide unique opportunities for the candidates to further build and advance their careers. Salary will be competitive based on experience and qualification. University of Oklahoma offers competitive benefits. Positions are open now until filled and full consideration will be given to applications received by 15 Jan. 2015.
