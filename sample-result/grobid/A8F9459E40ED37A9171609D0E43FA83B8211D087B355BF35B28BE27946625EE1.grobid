Definitions Principal Investigator (PI) is an employee of UCI (usually with an academic appointment) who is or becomes eligible under University policy to submit a proposal for extramural support of a research, training, or public service project. The PI has primary responsibility for the scientific, technical, and administrative conduct of a project. A PI must personally participate in the project to a significant degree; \"fronting\" as PI is contrary to University policy. Lead Researcher (LR) is a title signifying eligibility to perform research involving human and animal subjects and use of recombinant DNA (rDNA). Individuals serving as LR on IRB, IACUC and IBC protocols must have a formal affiliation (i.e., a faculty or staff appointment or enrolled student) with UCI. The type of appointment an individual has determines whether they may serve as a Lead Researcher on their own or whether a Faculty Sponsor is required. Faculty Sponsor i (FS) is a title signifying eligibility under University policy to submit proposals for extramural support of a research, training, or public service project; and to perform research involving human and animal subjects and use of recombinant DNA (rDNA)."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "UCI,ADMINISTRATIVE,POLICIES,PROCEDURES,RESEARCH,AND,SPONSORED,ACTIVITIES,Office,of,Research,Administration,Section,48021,Responsibilities,for,Conduct,Administration,of,Research,for,Principal,Investigators,and,Lead,Researchers", "filePath": "edu/uci/research/A8F9459E40ED37A9171609D0E43FA83B8211D087B355BF35B28BE27946625EE1"}}
