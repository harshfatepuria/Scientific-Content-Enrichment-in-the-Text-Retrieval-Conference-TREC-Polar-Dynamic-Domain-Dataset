Data were collected to evaluate the utility of using indirect measures of tufted puffin diets (stable isotopes and fatty acid signatures) as indicators of marine prey availability. We collected adipose tissue biopsies from the puffins to analyze for FAs and whole blood samples to analyze for nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes. All birds were captured at the breeding colony but it was rarely possible to determine breeding status. Because effects of nutritional status on physiological processes may confound information on diets furnished by stable isotope and fatty acid signature analyses, we also determined the effects of a ~50% reduction in food intake on (delta)15N and (delta)13C values in whole blood and fatty acid signatures of adipose tissue in growing tufted puffins. Beginning at age 10days, tufted puffins were fed a diet of either 120g/day (control group; 650 kJ/day, n=6)or 60g/day (experimental group; 325 kJ/day, n=7) of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) plus a multivitamin supplement. Blood and adipose tissue samples were collected and nestlings were weighed (\u00b1 2g) prior to feeding at ages 10, 19, 28, and 37 days."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Tufted,Puffins,as,biological,indicators,of,forage,fish,availability,in,the,Gulf,of,Alaska,assessing,diets,using,stable,isotopes,and,fatty,acid,signature,analysis,2004,20", "filePath": "edu/uaf/seagrant/995A4052E5470E98D23CBF9EEBB2C8EF4E14667D2DE3EE4FF92DDC9DB58D5C86"}}
