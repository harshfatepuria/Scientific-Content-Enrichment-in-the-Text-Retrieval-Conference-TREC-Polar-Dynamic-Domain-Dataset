For northern Israel, the WRF model precipitation prediction has been used in the Hydrological Model for Karst Environment (HYMKE) model to forecast streamflow in the upper Jordan River. The daily precipitation amount simulated by WRF at rain gauges located in the upper parts of the Jordan River basin showed very good agreement with the actual measurements. The hydrological modeling system that ingests the high-resolution WRF forecasted precipitation produced very good results, and significantly improved upon the current operational stream flow forecast method for the Jordan River that is being using up to now. In central Israel, 1.3 km WRF output are being use operationally to predict flash floods in the Yarqon River that drainage the Judea and Samaria hills and flow into the Metropolis of Tel Aviv. The modeling tools presented in this study are used to support the water-resource-assessment process, and studies of seasonal hydro-climate forecasting in this region."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "NCAR,Using,WRF,Model,Forcing,for,Predicting,Streamflow,at,the,Jordan,River,and,for,Predicting,Floods,in,a,Semiarid,Environment,The,RAL,Seminar,Series", "filePath": "edu/ucar/rap/www/02E64A687C7A72BC486BE3AFDB8385015D7648275DC357F4262B61C5BA05E2E5"}}
