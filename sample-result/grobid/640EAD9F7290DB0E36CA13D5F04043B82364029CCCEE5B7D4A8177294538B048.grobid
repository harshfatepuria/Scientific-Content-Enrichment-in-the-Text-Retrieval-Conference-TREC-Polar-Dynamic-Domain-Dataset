In setting these policies, the Board will seek the advice and assistance of the faculty, administration, and other relevant persons through the President. Each employee and student is responsible for following the approved policies. The administration is charged with the responsibility of organizing the staff for effective administration of the college and for preparing in detail, where applicable, the procedures for implementing the approved policies. If a situation demanding a decision is not covered by an existing policy or by procedures, the President is empowered to make the decision he deems best, reporting such decision to the Board at the next regular meeting. The President is responsible to the Board for the administration of the college under applicable laws and the policies of the Board. He shall select his staff and recommend them to the Board for appointment. He shall make, or designate the appropriate administrator to make, the necessary administrative decisions. It shall be the intent of the board to make available a sufficient number of qualified persons to administer the college efficiently and to require the President to organize it to ensure clear understanding of the functions of each person and the relationship between and among them; to establish the necessary councils, cabinets, and committees to provide for efficient operation of the college. To engage in this process in an orderly fashion, each group shall be given particular responsibilities, and channels shall be established so that the recommendations or decisions of each group can be heard and reviewed by the President and, where appropriate, by the Board. It shall be the policy in the organization and administration of the college to balance responsibility with commensurate authority subject to the reserved and legal powers of the Board. Therefore, a member of the administrative staff when assigned a responsibility or a position shall be given the authority to make the decisions necessary to perform the tasks.
