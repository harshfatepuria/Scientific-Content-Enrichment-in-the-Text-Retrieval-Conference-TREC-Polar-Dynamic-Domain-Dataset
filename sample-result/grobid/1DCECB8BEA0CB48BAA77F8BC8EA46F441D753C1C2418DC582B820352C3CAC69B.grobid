The Office of the General Counsel attempts to have the summer law clerk program consist of more than just legal research and writing. We endeavor to expose law clerks to the practice, as well as the substance, of law. In terms of research projects, preference is given to narrowly focused, relatively brief assignments, submitted by attorneys who are willing to work closely with the law clerks and to include them, when appropriate and possible, in meetings, hearings, negotiations, etc. The law clerks will support the attorneys in responding to client inquiries, as well as in developing tools and resources to assist clients at the campuses and at the Office of the President. Assistance will be provided across a broad spectrum of subject matters within the following practice groups: (1) business transactions and land use, (2) educational affairs, campus services, governance and compliance, (3) health law and medical center services, (4) litigation, and (5) labor and employment. Assigning attorneys are expected to give constructive and comprehensive feedback to the law clerks on their work product. If interested, please submit your coversheet, resume, transcript and writing sample in a single PDF file (e.g., Doe_John.PDF) to OGC-Resumes@sp2010.ucop.edu. To ensure full consideration, candidates should apply by January 9, 2015. The positions will remain open until filled. The Office of the General Counsel is located at 1111 Franklin Street, 8th Floor, Oakland, California 94607.
