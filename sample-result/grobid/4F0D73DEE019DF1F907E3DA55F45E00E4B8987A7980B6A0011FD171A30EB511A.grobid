Assessing snow stability requires a holistic approach, relying on avalanche, snowpack and weather observations. Part of this assessment utilizes stability tests, but these tests can be unreliable due in part to the spatial variability of test results. Conducting more than one test can help to mitigate this uncertainty, though it is unclear how far apart to space tests to optimize our assessments. Furthermore, previous work has mainly focused on one spatial scale, be that at the point, slope or mountain range scale and there is limited understanding about how to relate these to each other. To further complicate these issues, the temporal evolution of the snowpack stability is also poorly understood in a spatial context. How quickly do weaknesses in the snowpack strengthen and does this happen uniformly? What methods do we have to measure these changes? And how do we apply this to everyday avalanche forecasting? This presentation will provide an overview of these issues and how we intend to address some of these gaps in our understanding."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "NCAR,The,Role,of,Spatial,Variability,for,Avalanche,Forecasting,The,RAL,Seminar,Series", "filePath": "edu/ucar/rap/www/4F0D73DEE019DF1F907E3DA55F45E00E4B8987A7980B6A0011FD171A30EB511A"}}
