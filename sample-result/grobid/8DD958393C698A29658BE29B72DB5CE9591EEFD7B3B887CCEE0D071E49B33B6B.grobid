It may surprise you, but some of your colleagues are not meteorologists. With that in mind, keep your talk general. Explain how your research fits in the broad background of Earth Systems Science. Why does the subject interest you, and why should it interest others? \u2022 Be careful of presenting too much information. Slides should be simple with a few clear points. It's difficult to read and comprehend a lot of text, especially while listening to someone talk. If your audience is confused by something in your slides or overwhelmed by lengthy text, they often simply ignore them. \u2022 Slides for fluent English speakers. If English is your native language, or you feel confident that you can be easily understood, then you should use your slides to add to your spoken presentation. In other words, don't read your slides. Use your slides as an outline for what you're going to say; you can go into more detail in your speech. For example, if this slide were to be used in a talk, only the bulleted comments would be shown, and the text underneath each bullet would be spoken. \u2022 Slides for non-fluent English speakers. If English is your second, third, or n-th language it may be helpful if you do read your slides. People often have difficulty understanding others' accents. Other times it may help the speaker remember or pronounce words that they don't commonly use. \u2022 Equations Explain your equations. What does each symbol represent?
