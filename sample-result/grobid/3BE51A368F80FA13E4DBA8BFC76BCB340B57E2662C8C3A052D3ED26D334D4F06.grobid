Do all locations have to use the form provided or can they customize a form for the SMG members? A. All locations must use the Performance Management for Senior Administrators form. The form template should not be changed or customized. Using the same form across multiple locations allows the results to be more readily compared and fairly measured. It also ensures a continuity of process and makes certain that all SMG members are measured and reviewed using similar standards. Q. How should the five-year reviews be handled? Must all current SMG members have a five-year review effective July 1, 2013? A. Each location should assess the resources required for the five-year SMG reviews and structure the review timelines accordingly. At the end of each five-year period, all SMG members are required to have a completed five-year review. As new SMG members are hired, their five-year review should be established based upon their date of hire or appointment into an SMG position. Q. If someone is in an \"acting\" SMG role, does the policy apply to them? A. Yes. An individual in an acting SMG role is covered under the SMG Performance Management policies.
