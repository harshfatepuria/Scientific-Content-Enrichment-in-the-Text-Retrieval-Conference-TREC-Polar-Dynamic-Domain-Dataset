Knowledge of vortex boundary layer dynamics, tropical cyclogenesis theory, balanced and unbalanced vortex models, Lagrangian transport and Lagrangian coherent structures is highly desired. Experience with global forecast models, mesoscale high-resolution forecast models, as well as with highly idealized fluid dynamical and thermodynamical models, will be preferred. The research assistant professors are expected to work closely with faculty on the identified focus areas, as well as to continue and generate their own areas of research and extramural funding that compliments their collaborative work with faculty. The candidates are expected to publish their research results in leading peer-reviewed journals, and to be able to work in a team environment that includes collaboration with military graduate students on their thesis research. The candidates should be able also to assist in the management of sponsored research programs. The successful candidates will have a doctoral degree in a discipline supporting their research expertise. The candidates need to be able to demonstrate research aptitude in the required areas of expertise.
