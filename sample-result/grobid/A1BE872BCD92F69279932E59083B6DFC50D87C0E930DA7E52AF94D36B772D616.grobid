Under the administration of University Life, the department implements and coordinates reasonable accommodations and disability-related services that afford equal access to university programs and activities. The Office of Disability Services is available to serve all students with disabilities, including those with cognitive (e.g., learning, psychological, and closed head injury), sensory, mobility, and other physical impairments. As part of University Life's commitment to recognizing and honoring the richness of diversity at Mason, the ODS staff members actively participate in the campus-wide diversity dialogue. The ODS welcomes and encourages all students with disabilities, whether registered with the ODS or not, to identify themselves as members of the disability community, and to engage in the diversity dialogue on campus by getting involved with the ODS and other multicultural programs and activities. Mission The Office of Disability Services strives to: \u2022 Promote equal access to students with disabilities in curricular and co-curricular activities within the university experience. \u2022 Foster partnerships with students, faculty, and staff to create environments that are accessible, diverse, and inclusive. \u2022 Empower students to fully participate in the university community. The Office of Disability Services at George Mason University offers a variety of services for students with documented disabilities. We encourage both prospective and current students to learn more about our services by going to our web site at and/or calling our office to make an appointment with an Office of Disability Services coordinator.
