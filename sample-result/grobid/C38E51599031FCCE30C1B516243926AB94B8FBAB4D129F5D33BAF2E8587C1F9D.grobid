The main objectives are to improve our specification of ionosphere and plasmasphere in response to external forcing from both above and below, and to couple to whole atmosphere models for understanding the impact of the terrestrial weather to space weather. The model describes the time dependent, three-dimensional, global density of nine ion species, electron density, temperatures of electron and ions in the ionosphere and plasmasphere. The parallel plasma transport is based on the Field Line Interhemispheric Plasma (FLIP) Model [Richards et al., 1990]. A realistic model of Earth's magnetic field is implemented by using the APEX coordinate system [Richmond, 1995]. Global, seamless plasma transport perpendicular to the magnetic field has been included all the way from the equator to the poles. The electrodynamics solver based on the TIEGCM [Richmond and Maute 2013] calculates the global electric field self-consistently. By taking advantage of the great spatial coverage of the COSMIC observations, global TEC and electron density from the IPE model has been compared with the COSMIC observations to validate the model. In this presentation, the comparisons are shown for quiet time climatology and space weather events including Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSW) and Weddell Sea Anomaly (WSA)."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Ionosphere,Plasmasphere,Electrodynamics,IPE,Model,Development,for,Understanding,Connection,Between,Terrestrial,and,Space,Weather", "filePath": "edu/ucar/cosmic/www/C38E51599031FCCE30C1B516243926AB94B8FBAB4D129F5D33BAF2E8587C1F9D"}}
