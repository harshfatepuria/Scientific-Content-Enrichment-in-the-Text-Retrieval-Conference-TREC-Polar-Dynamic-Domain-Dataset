Subject: Current Federal Regulations for research involving human participants (45 CFR 46) require that studies undergo a continuing review of the research at least annually. In its Federalwide Assurance (FWA 00004513) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Cornell University commits to complying with these federal regulations for all federally funded research. Limiting the scope of its FWA to federally funded research allows Cornell's Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) and its Institutional Review Board (IRB) some flexibility in its application of federal regulations to studies that are not federally funded. In doing so, Cornell does not compromise its commitment to following the ethical principles of the Belmont Report (National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research) and applying the highest ethical standards for the protection of all human participants for all Cornell research. Since many research studies conducted at Cornell University Ithaca campus pose no more than minimal risk to the participants, annual continuing reviews of such projects does not materially increase the protection of research participants' rights and welfare. A Triennial (three-year) Approval for such studies will reduce the administrative burden on investigators while continuing to maintain high standards for the protection of human participants in Cornell research. This policy describes the criteria under which a Triennial Approval may be granted and the corresponding initial and ongoing review and approval procedures. 2. Policy statements 2.1. IRB approval for a study will be valid for a (3) three-year period (Triennial Approval) if the study meets the following conditions: \u2022 Poses no more than minimal risk or harms to human participants.
