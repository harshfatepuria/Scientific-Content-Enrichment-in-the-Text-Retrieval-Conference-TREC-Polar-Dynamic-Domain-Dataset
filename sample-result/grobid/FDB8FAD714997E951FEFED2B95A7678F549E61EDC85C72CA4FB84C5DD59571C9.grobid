On September 27, 2008, the National Museum of Natural History will open a new permanent Ocean Hall-an $80 million initiative, the museum's largest in a century. Smithsonian Ocean was commissioned especially for the Ocean Hall but it is much more than a companion volume. Deborah Cramer, one of the country's most celebrated science writers, has written an engaging and perspective-changing history of the ocean. Her text is gorgeously illustrated, and her argument compelling. Smithsonian Ocean offers a magnificent journey through space and time that concludes with an ocean ethic we ignore at our peril.
