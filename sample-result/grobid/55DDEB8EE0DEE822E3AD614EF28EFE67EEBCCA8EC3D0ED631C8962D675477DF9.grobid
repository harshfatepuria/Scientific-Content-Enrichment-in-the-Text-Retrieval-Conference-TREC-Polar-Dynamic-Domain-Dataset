Develop, communicate and justify an evidence-based scientific explanation to account for Earth's different climates b. Research and evaluate direct and indirect evidence to explain how climates vary from one location to another on Earth c. Examine, evaluate, and question information from a variety of sources and media to investigate how climates vary from one location to another on Earth Inquiry Questions: \u2022 How does the climate in one area compare and contrast with another area? \u2022 Why are there different climates on Earth? \u2022 How has Earth's climate changed over time? \u2022 What evidence supports and/or contradicts human influence on climate change? \u2022 What is the difference between weather and climate?
