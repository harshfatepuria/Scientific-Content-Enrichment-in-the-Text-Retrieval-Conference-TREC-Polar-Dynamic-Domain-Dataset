In this research, 3DVAR and 4DVAR with WRF have been conducted to assimilate FORMOSAT-\u00ad\u20103/COSMIC radio occultation (GPS RO) data in simulations of typhoon Morakot, Typhoon Maggie, Typhoon Fanapi and the heavy Mei-\u00ad\u2010Yu rainfall event in June 11-\u00ad\u201012, 2012. The simulation results with the WRF 3DVAR and 4DVAR will be compared and discussed. The impacts of FORMOSAT-\u00ad\u20103/COSMIC GPS RO data assimilation with those two different methods on numerical simulation of Typhoons and heavy Mei-\u00ad\u2010Yu rainfall event will also be investigated. Our results show that the WRF 4DVAR assimilation method could be used to simulate typhoon central pressure much better than the WRF 3DVAR method. For the rainfall forecast, the simulation results of WRF 4DVAR method also could be better than using the WRF 3DVAR assimilation technique. The physical processes responsible for the improvement of regional weather forecast of typhoons and the heavy Mei-\u00ad\u2010Yu rainfall case will be also discussed in this research."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "A,Comparative,Study,of,GPS,RO,Data,Assimilation,with,3DVAR,and,4DVAR,Methods,on,the,Simulations,of,Typhoons,and,MeiYu,Heavy,Rainfall,Event,PayLiam", "filePath": "edu/ucar/cosmic/www/EA7526A164DECB77DBF160DD24CFB2AFA68FA5A9E9CDBE4E01FEBF9B21EEFED0"}}
