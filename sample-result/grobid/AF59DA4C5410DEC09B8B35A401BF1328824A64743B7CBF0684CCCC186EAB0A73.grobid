However, only recently has the scale of these alterations become apparent. The human fingerprint is abundantly seen in the global atmosphere, the world oceans, and the land of all continents. This insight has brought about profound changes in the goals, priorities and processes of both science and government. Today, there is tremendous scientific, as well as societal, interest in how climate will change over the next several decades. There are many scientific questions to be answered; for instance, the likelihood of changes in extreme events at the regional scale. Such regional scale simulations will require an ensemble of runs using finer resolution models, likely with the inclusion of simple chemistry, aerosols, and dynamic vegetation. Serious discussions of using the CCSM to produce short-term climate simulations have arisen at the past several CCSM Advisory Board (CAB) meetings, including a lengthy discussion led by Motivated primarily by the critical scientific questions, opportunities and challenges presented by this approach, and the generally high level of enthusiasm within NCAR for it, the goal of this preliminary prospectus is to gather community feedback on this idea and its implementation in the framework of the CCSM. In particular, such an effort cannot be successful without a strong community contribution and, at this stage, help in identifying the key issues and challenges. There was some community feedback providing important input to the November 10 th , 2006 SSC meeting, where the prospectus was thoroughly discussed by the SSC. It is important to emphasize that these short-term simulations would be done in addition to the more traditional type of climate change scenarios out to 2100 and beyond. The CCSM implementation plan outlines the procedure to produce a CCSM 4 to be used for these traditional scenario runs that include some form of carbon cycle and the indirect effects of aerosols. At the aforementioned WGCM/AIMES workshop, these traditional scenario runs and the new short-term simulations have both been proposed as standard integrations for the IPCC AR5. The proposed form for these short-term climate simulations would likely be: a) Starting the integrations in 1980, or perhaps a few years earlier in order to capture the mid-1970s \" climate shift \" , and then run in pure simulation or simulation/assimilation mode until 2005. The short-term simulation would be from 2006 to 2030."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "PROSPECTUS,FOR,SHORTTERM,CLIMATE,SIMULATIONS,USING,THE,CCSM", "filePath": "edu/ucar/cesm/www/AF59DA4C5410DEC09B8B35A401BF1328824A64743B7CBF0684CCCC186EAB0A73"}}
