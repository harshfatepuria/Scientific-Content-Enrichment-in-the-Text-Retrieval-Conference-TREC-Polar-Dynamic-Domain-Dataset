This pronouncement has framed subsequent discussions despite concern raised elsewhere in Chapter 18 of the same assessment that \" current knowledge of adaptation and adaptive capacity is insufficient for reliable prediction of adaptations (pg. 880) \" because \" the capacity to adapt varies considerably among regions, countries and socioeconomic groups and will vary over time (pg. 879) \". In an attempt to reconcile this apparent contradiction, we employ the IPCC (2001) framework that vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to organize a synthetic assessment of new knowledge and available tools to produce geographically explicit qualitative portraits of vulnerability designed explicitly to incorporate both exposure to climate change (across a range of futures as reflected in temperature change) and subjective judgments of national capacities to adapt.
