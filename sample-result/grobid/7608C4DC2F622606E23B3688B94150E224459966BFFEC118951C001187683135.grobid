This might be attributed to the lack of adequate field or laboratory measurements, to the inevitable difficulties in numerical simulations (arising from small scales of motion due to stratification) and to the intrinsic complexity of SBL dynamics (e.g., occurrences of intermittency, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, gravity waves, low-level jets, and meandering motions). My research group and collaborators are trying to gain a better understanding of SBL turbulence by synergistically combining modeling approaches (e.g., single column, large-eddy, and mesoscale modeling), observational techniques (e.g., small-aperture scintillometry, and sodar), and by borrowing a suite of tools from the emergent field of complex systems. In this talk, I present a m\u00e9lange of ongoing research projects ranging from SBL height parameterization using artificial neural networks to large-eddy simulation of low-level jets; from runaway cooling problem in atmospheric models to synthetic inflow generation for wind turbine design."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "NCAR,Addressing,Some,Outstanding,Problems,in,Stable,Boundary,Layer,Turbulence,The,RAL,Seminar,Series", "filePath": "edu/ucar/rap/www/7608C4DC2F622606E23B3688B94150E224459966BFFEC118951C001187683135"}}
