After this we will consider briefly the relationships between three different descriptions of physical phenomena in space plasmas: (1) single particle motion in electromagnetic fields; (2) kinetic theory of plasmas that are not collision dominated; (3) fluid theory of plasmas that either are collision dominated or can be satisfactorily treated as such. This discussion will involve the introduction of the concept of conservation laws. Next, taking the fluid perspective, we will consider the acceleration and heating of fully and partially ionized plasmas by transfer of electromagnetic energy to the plasma, and we will briefly touch on an example of the inverse of this process\u2014viz., the growth of electromagnetic waves at the expense of the plasma energy. Specific examples of heating and acceleration processes will be given in the following contexts: the quasi-steady solar corona and solar wind; magnetic field line reconnection in solar flares, at the dayside magnetopause, and in the magnetotail; and current dissipation in the E region of the ionosphere. In the follow-on problem and interactive discussion session, a small number of problems (based on the material discussed in the lecture) will be provided for selected groups to work on, with the goal of stimulating further interaction between the students and the speaker. Each small group will be made up of students with varying degrees of familiarity with the material considered.
