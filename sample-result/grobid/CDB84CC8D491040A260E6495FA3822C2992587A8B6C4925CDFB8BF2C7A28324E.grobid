Exceptional diversity-related performance includes, but goes beyond, compliance; what is required by University policy, and state and federal equal employment and affirmative action regulations. It involves exercising leadership in creating a campus climate that is inclusive and welcomes diversity, holding staff accountable for diversity-related performance and achievements, and taking proactive steps to promote institutional diversity goals and initiatives. Evaluating performance in the area of diversity and inclusion will be particularly important going forward as the campus implements new federal regulations regarding outreach, hiring, retaining and promoting applicants and employees with disabilities and protected veteran status.
