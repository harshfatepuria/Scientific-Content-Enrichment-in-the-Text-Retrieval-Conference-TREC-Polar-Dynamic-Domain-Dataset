An up-to-date observational characterization of the MJO will be presented, including discussion of results from the recent CINDY/DYNAMO field program. New theoretical developments on MJO dynamics will then be discussed, including a discussion of how theoretical advances have helped us improve the representation of the MJO in global models. The talk will then include a discussion of MJO impacts and the potential for improved prediction of global weather and climate phenomena based on knowledge of the MJO and its improved representation in global models. Particular phenomena influenced by the MJO that will be discussed include tropical cyclones, El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, monsoon active and break periods, and high latitude extreme events.
