See How to self-register for a TATO module Modules currently available: 1. Staying Out of Trouble: UA Policies (required for TAs) These interactive lessons on UA policies teach by asking TAs to apply each policy appropriately in a variety of situations drawn from actual experiences. TAs must earn 95% or higher on the final test not later than two weeks after the start of classes. The Graduate College monitors test scores. Topics covered include: academic integrity, code of conduct, conflict of interest, copyright, disability resources, disruptive and threatening behavior, FERPA, non-discrimination/anti-harassment, syllabus (policy on, how to write), legal services for students, UA Dean of Students, UA Manuals and Policies, UA Police. Additional resources are also provided At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to: \u2022 identify a situation in which there exists a conflict of interest \u2022 give examples of an \"educational record\" \u2022 respond appropriately to inquiries from parents or others who request to see student grades \u2022 identify disruptive and threatening behaviors and have some strategies for handling these situations \u2022 give examples of discrimination \u2022 identify what is and what is not sexual harassment \u2022 identify how to report violations of UA policies \u2022 describe behavior that is prohibited by the Code of Conduct \u2022 distinguish between the medical and socio-political models of \"disability\" \u2022 define universal design and describe universal design practices in your teaching \u2022 identify what information is required in a course syllabus \u2022 describe your responsibilities and how to report violations of UA policies \u2022 identify resources that assist in learning more about UA policies"}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "UA,Office,of,Instruction,and,Assessment,Teaching,Assistant,Training,ONLINE,TATO", "filePath": "edu/arizona/geography/7CE667DF2F6445DBD9C72BB5B31F67E22D9DCD2B39FDDB1AEE844B6F3211AA54"}}
