Through the educational and public programs planned for the Human Origins Initiative, visitors of all ages can engage onsite and online with authentic science and scientists, and go \" behind the scenes \" into the field, into the lab and into a unique, interactive museum experience that illuminates the major milestones in the origin of human beings. In addition, Onsite Learning seeks to foster dialogue through personal interactions with scientists, volunteers and other visitors. Activities are designed to be adaptable to visitors' needs and can be scaled to other exhibitions through ongoing evaluation.
