Technically it is operated as a United States government \" State Aircraft \" in the FAA \" Public \" category. This means that the aircraft does not have the same payload certification requirements as the GV. While not required to do so, EOL maintains and operates the aircraft under FAA Part 25 regulations and attempts to comply with basic military specifications for a Model C-130Q airframe. The avionics and communications equipment are suitably advanced enough to allow the conduct of international flight operations under the \" State Aircraft \" classification. 4.2 Crew Duty Limitations Adequate rest for crew members is essential for the safe and efficient operations of NSF/NCAR aircraft in support of research programs. The restrictions in this section are the minima and maxima allowable. The 14-hour duty limit is intended for short, intensive operational periods and is not to be considered as a normal work day for NCAR flight crews. Investigators must be aware of other factors that flight crews must contend with, such as the fatiguing effects of continued IFR operation, extremes of temperature, complexity of mission requirements, and other variables that the pilot-in-command must consider in determining actual crew limits for any operation. During extensive research periods, proper rest becomes increasingly important, and when deemed necessary, the project pilot may elect to declare additional crew rest periods other than those listed below. Specific project flight schedules may necessitate additional staffing in order to meet the crew duty limitation requirements specified."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "C130,Investigators,Handbook,Chapter,4,Flight,Operations,41,Aircraft,Certification,Overview,public", "filePath": "edu/ucar/eol/www/568A35DD97840EFDD1CD06DB5579B60BDAC93D608AA2C97303B26C982CB62500"}}
