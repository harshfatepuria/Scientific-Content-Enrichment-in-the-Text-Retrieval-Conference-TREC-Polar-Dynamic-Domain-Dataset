Individual courses are also open to those who are not pursuing a certificate. Core courses are offered at least twice per year (all seven required): 1. Historical Overview: Power, Privilege and Oppression (*NEW REGISTRANTS ONLY*) The purpose of this course is to analyze how power operates through policies, systems, and structures; and develop a historical context for understanding oppression, privilege, power, resistance, and social change. Participants will also reflect on one's own multiple identities within history and society and examine how power and privilege can hinder community building in the workplace. 2. Overview of Diversity, Retention and Inclusion: Successes and Challenges at UCSC This presentation by the Associate Chancellor gives participants an understanding of the status of diversity demographics and initiatives at UCSC, as well as the goals and values of the campus around promoting diversity and inclusion. 3. Understanding Race/Ethnicity and National Origin This workshop uses a social justice education approach to examining the multifaceted, complex, and dynamic system of oppression as it is manifested in one aspect of social identity \u2013 race/ethnicity and national origin. Participants will review the history of the construction of race in the United States and explore the reality of racism via individual, institutional, and societal/cultural manifestations (intentional/conscious and unintentional/unconscious). Through exploring our own socialization into a system of oppression (including our own worldviews, values, and assumptions), we can begin to understand the social power dynamics that result in some social groups having privilege, status, and access while other groups are disadvantaged, oppressed, and denied access. In doing so, we will focus on developing critical consciousness and individual and social action to eliminate oppression to achieve greater equity and fairness in the workplace and beyond. Multiple learning formats will be used during the three hour workshop including lecture/presentation, multimedia, experiential/interactive, group discussion, and self-reflection. 4. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) Issues in the Workplace & Beyond This class will invite participants to explore-and address-the challenges that LGBT people experience in the workplace. Participants will learn about various LGBT groups, gain a sense of recent LGBT history, and become familiar with LGBT demographics at UC and beyond. After being introduced to some of the major challenges that LGBT people face outside the workplace, participants will focus on LGBT workplace concerns, discussing in-depth how they can best be addressed. Participants will also receive information about UC's policies visa -vis LGBT employees and students, together with resources for ongoing learning and discussion. 5. Communicating Across Generations UCSC prides itself on being a diverse community, and there are four distinct generations working side by side on our campus. This interactive workshop explores the differences and similarities among the generations and how it affects our working relationships. Participants will gain new tools and strategies to build trust, improve working relationships and resolve intergenerational conflicts. Participants will gain new tools and strategies for: \u2022 Understanding four generations \u2013 Traditionalists, Baby Boomers, Gen Xers and Gen Y/Millenials \u2022 Exploring the impact generational differences have on values, communication styles, lifestyles, outlook, career expectations, etc. \u2022 Leveraging generational strengths to achieve shared goals \u2022 Building trust and positive relationships \u2022 Resolving intergenerational conflicts"}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "201415,Diversity,and,Inclusion,Certificate,Program,For,Course,Schedules,and,Registration,visit,httplearningcenterucscedu,AddChangeDelete,using,your,Gold,CruzID", "filePath": "edu/ucsc/diversity/2AF2EBE6566BD0DD33BC85112E7AA5C2A8C99FD5FFEF2308D76D21D2F8DCEBE7"}}
