Businesses want input for use in strategic planning activities. Cities, counties and states are concerned about the climate impacts on aging infra-structure. Engineers and architects are grappling with changing design baselines as updated climate records dictate changes. Finally, building designers are concerned with developing \" green footprints \" and sustainability issues for new construction. Meteorologists, climatologists and atmospheric scientists are in the middle of this swirling information hurricane that is impacting our nation's business community on an ever increasing scale. As a meteorologist working within the engineering environment for the past seven years, examples of projects that met these challenges over the past five years will be given. The recent surge in new data bases from the NEXRAD WSR-88D Doppler radars, computer archived outputs, surface mesonets, profilers, ACARS, GPS-IPW and numerous satellite outputs provide a rich texture of information to be applied to these issues. Given that climate change issues are driving strong market needs, opportunities abound for the weather enterprise with roles, at times overlapping, for all sectors. A measured solution that provides robust gains for all sectors is proposed that is based on a realistic assessment of the potential contributions and actual strengths of each sector.
