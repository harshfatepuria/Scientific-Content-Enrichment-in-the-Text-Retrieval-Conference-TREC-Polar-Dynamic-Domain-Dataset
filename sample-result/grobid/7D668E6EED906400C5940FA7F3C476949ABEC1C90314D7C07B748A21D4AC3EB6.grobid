Here I will first outline some of the factors relating to hurricane changes and provide an update on community assessments based on a recently published consensus report from a WMO team. I will follow this with a presentation of recent climate simulations here at NCAR to highlight both the difficulties and pitfalls involved and the multiple approaches that can be adopted. Third will be a general discussion of recent hurricane predictions and issues arising. Finally, I will use an extreme value viewpoint to show how logical it is to expect marked changes in weather extremes in general (hurricanes in particular) with both climate variability and change. Indeed the weather extremes may provide the best bellwether for identifying climate change as it develops."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Advanced,Study,Program,Seminar,at,11,am,Foothills,Laboratory,Building,2,Room,1022,Large,Auditorium,Refreshments,served,before,the,seminar,Climate,Trends,and,Variability,in,Atlantic,Hurricanes", "filePath": "edu/ucar/asp/www/7D668E6EED906400C5940FA7F3C476949ABEC1C90314D7C07B748A21D4AC3EB6"}}
