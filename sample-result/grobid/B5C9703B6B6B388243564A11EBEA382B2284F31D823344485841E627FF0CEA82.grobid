Many points without area estimates in past versions were arbitrarily assigned areas of 200 sq. km. In the 2011 release, the 2010 results were recalculated so that the correct areas were used, and points without areas were not included. Note that in the future, from the 2012 release onwards, the target will be moved to a weighted average of 17% of biome area protected, which is based on a revised target established at the Convention on Biological Diversity Conference of Parties 10 in Nagoya, Japan, October 2010. We also plan to use data provided by the UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre which is based on a slightly different methodology in which the time series is developed by the date of establishment of the protected area rather than on the basis of the latest release of the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). This will ensure that any changes in percent of biomes protected will be due to actual changes in protected status and not due to improvements to the database (such as improved protected area boundary information). Each annual release will use the most up to date WDPA for calculating the time series."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "EcoRegion,Protection,Indicator,for,the,2011,release,of,the,Natural,Resource,Management,Index,of,the,Millennium,Challenge,Corporation,Data,and,Methodology", "filePath": "edu/columbia/ciesin/sedac/B5C9703B6B6B388243564A11EBEA382B2284F31D823344485841E627FF0CEA82"}}
