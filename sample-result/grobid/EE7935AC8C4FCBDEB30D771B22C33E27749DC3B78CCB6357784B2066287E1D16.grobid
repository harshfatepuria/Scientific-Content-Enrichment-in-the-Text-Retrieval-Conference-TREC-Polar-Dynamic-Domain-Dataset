USAID commissioned four case studies to test a six-step vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) approach focused on adaptation projects and issued the V&A guidance manual in 2007. Since the release of the guidance, USAID has provided training on the use of the V&A approach and continued to apply it in additional case studies. Over the course of this four-plus years of application, USAID has determined that the V&A approach needed to be revised to facilitate planning at the national and sector levels to account for both climate and non-climate stressors. The presentation will document the transition from the earlier V&A to the mainstreaming guidance."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "NCAR,USAIDs,Guidance,on,Mainstreaming,Climate,Change,into,Development,The,RAL,Seminar,Series", "filePath": "edu/ucar/rap/www/EE7935AC8C4FCBDEB30D771B22C33E27749DC3B78CCB6357784B2066287E1D16"}}
