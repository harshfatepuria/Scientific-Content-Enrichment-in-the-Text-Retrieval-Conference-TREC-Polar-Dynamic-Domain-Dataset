We seek candidates with primary teaching and research interests in British literature, encompassing more than one national or linguistic tradition and/or more than one geographical area. We are particularly interested in candidates who can contribute to existing departmental and divisional/university-wide strengths in any of the following approaches and areas: empire, race, and colonial/postcolonial studies; gender and sexuality studies; urban studies; environmental humanities; Jewish Studies; transatlantic and ocean studies; cognitive humanities and science/technology studies; creative practice; critical theory; digital humanities/new media. We seek scholars with demonstrated teaching excellence, and with evidence of a developed research trajectory. Candidates will be expected to teach a range of large undergraduate lecture courses as well as smaller courses and seminars, and to contribute significantly to graduate education and the mentoring of graduate students. We are particularly interested in candidates with administrative skill and leadership potential interested in the possibility of directing the Dickens Project, a Multicampus Research Unit (MRU) of the University of California headquartered at UCSC, though they need not be Dickens specialists. The successful candidate must be able to work with students, faculty and staff from a wide range of social and cultural backgrounds. We are especially interested in candidates who can contribute to the diversity and excellence of the academic community. This position carries a five-course equivalency workload, which normally means teaching four courses over three quarters and carrying other academic and service responsibilities.
