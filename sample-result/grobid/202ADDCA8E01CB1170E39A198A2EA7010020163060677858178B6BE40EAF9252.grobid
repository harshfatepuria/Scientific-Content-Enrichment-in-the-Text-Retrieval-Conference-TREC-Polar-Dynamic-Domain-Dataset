This talk will present some of the international activities, including the GFCS, which cover many of the important aspects relevant to climate services, such as observations and monitoring of climate, underpinning research, modelling and prediction, availability of climate information, development of products, user engagement, collaboration, and capacity building. At the national level this talk will show examples of climate services provided by the UK Met Office. Bio: Dr Chris Hewitt is Head of Climate Service Development at the Met Office in the UK. He is responsible for developing strategic relationships to improve and maximise the use of climate service capabilities. He is part of the core writing team for the GFCS Implementation Plan and part of the core team (along with colleagues from NCAR) of the newly formed International Climate Services Partnership.
