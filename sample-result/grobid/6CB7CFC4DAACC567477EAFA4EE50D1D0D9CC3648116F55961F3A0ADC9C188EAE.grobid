The two largest US anthropogenic NO x sources are motor vehicles and the generation of electric power by coal combustion. Our recent work examines atmospheric vertical columns of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) detected by space-based instruments and calculated by a regional air quality model. We use these comparisons to evaluate bottom-up inventories and infer trends in NO x emissions from power plants and motor vehicles. We show that a decline in NO2 columns detected by satellite instruments over the Ohio River Valley since the 1990's is a direct result of NO x emission reductions due to pollution controls implemented at coal-burning power plants. In another study, we demonstrate that power plants NO x emissions in the western US are well understood but that emissions from motor vehicles in urban areas across the West are probably overestimated by inventories. Satellite observations demonstrate significant recent declines and day-of-week trends in motor vehicle NO x emissions in some western US cities."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Advanced,Study,Program,Seminar,US,NOx,Emissions,Evaluated,by,Spacebased,Observations,and,Model,Simulations", "filePath": "edu/ucar/asp/www/6CB7CFC4DAACC567477EAFA4EE50D1D0D9CC3648116F55961F3A0ADC9C188EAE"}}
