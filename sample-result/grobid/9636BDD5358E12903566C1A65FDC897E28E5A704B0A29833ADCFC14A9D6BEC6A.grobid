Data Management", "level": "a", "type": "main"}}}, "profileDesc": {"abstract": {"p": "The development and maintenance of a comprehensive and accurate data archive is critical in meeting the scientific objectives of VORTEX2. An archive that allows VORTEX2 investigators to share data with each other and with the rest of the scientific community helps these investigators promptly publish significant findings and transfer new knowledge into operational severe storm prediction. The overall guiding philosophy for VORTEX2 data management is to make datasets available to the scientific community as soon as possible after the field project while at the same time accommodating legitimate interests of investigators who collect the data. 7.1 VORTEX2 Data Policy In order to accomplish the goals described in the VORTEX2 Scientific Program Overview (SPO) and in individual proposals, VORTEX2 investigators will use a combination of field observations and operational data. Policies for using the VORTEX2 field observations are described in the current and next sections while procedures for archiving and accessing operational data are described later. Individual investigators are devoting significant time and resources in preparing to collect, collecting, and analyzing VORTEX2 field observations. After the 2009 and 2010 field phases, investigators will need ample time to identify cases of interest, preprocess observations (data conversion, quality control, etc.), analyze observations, and to begin publishing results. An initial data-analysis period is planned to accommodate the needs of individual investigators. The initial data-analysis period lasts 16 months after the data to prioritize cases, discuss research avenues, and develop plans for analyzing VORTEX2 data efficiently in a coordinated and collaborative manner. Having an initial data-analysis period and coordinating research through workshops satisfies the following project needs: (a) significant findings should be published promptly; (b) PIs need time to peruse the data they collected and to prepare them for analysis, sharing, and publication; (c) research niches should be identified for students, who must produce original research and typically require 1-3 years to do so; and (d) research naturally progresses from analyses of data from a single or small number of instruments initially to integrated analyses of multi-platform observations later. In addition, VORTEX2 PIs will participate in an End-of-Season Meeting, which will occur in the field immediately after the last day of operations (i.e., most likely one or two days after the last day of operations). A preliminary discussion of analysis plans will occur, so that PIs can begin analysis and have results in time for summer and fall conferences. The more comprehensive plan for coordinated data analysis will not be developed until the October/November VORTEX2 Research Workshop. After the VORTEX2 Research Workshops, VORTEX2 PIs shall promptly provide data to other PIs upon request and in accordance with the coordinated analysis plans developed at the workshops. Data sharing can be accomplished either through direct communication among PIs or through the VORTEX2 Data Archive (Section 7.4) with the permission of the PI who collected the data. After the 16-month initial data-analysis period, all VORTEX2 data will be considered public domain. If the team of investigators who collected a dataset wishes to make the dataset available in the public domain before the end of the 16-month period, they may do so. Until a dataset is in the public domain, the dataset may not be provided to a third party (someone who is not a VORTEX2 PI) for journal articles, presentations, research proposals, etc. unless the team of investigators who collected the data provides consent. Users (including both VORTEX2 PIs and third parties) of VORTEX2 field data should acknowledge and/or offer co-authorship to the investigators who collected the data."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "7,Data,Management", "filePath": "edu/ucar/eol/www/9636BDD5358E12903566C1A65FDC897E28E5A704B0A29833ADCFC14A9D6BEC6A"}}
