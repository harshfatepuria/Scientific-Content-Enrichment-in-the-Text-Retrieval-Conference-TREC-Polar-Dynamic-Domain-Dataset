There was no agenda. Roger was asked if he had any items he wished to discuss, but he said at this point he wanted to hear from the NSA. The NSA EC raised several topics, but two of them dominated the discussion: (1) the implementation of the Workforce Management Plan's recommendation to provide 100% support for ladder scientists and research engineers, and (2) the status and treatment of Project Scientists at NCAR. Members of the NSA EC expressed concern over the implementation of the above WMP recommendation, and questioned Roger and Maura over several points. Concerns included: overly restrictive constraints on attracting new ladder staff from purely financial considerations (which may lead to a top-heavy staff distribution and lack of infusion of new talents); questions over the meaning of \" hard \" (base) money versus \" soft \" (grant) money, and whether this difference makes real sense as an accounting tool; the segregations of staff into class (ladder track) staff, and others (notably project scientists, associate scientists). Roger and Maura acknowledged these problems, and stated further that the WMP plan also presents accounting difficulties. They confirmed that the desire to implement the plan comes from the need to be able to better handle financial difficulties-previous financial challenges a few years ago led to the need to release senior scientists-and account to the UCAR Board of Trustees. Roger signaled that at least some of these difficulties need to be addressed. Roger informed the group that the ladder staff, irrespective of division/laboratory (with the notable exception of RAL, which clearly falls short of that level of ladder staff base support), is already covered by base funds at about 75% level. However, it was noted that for some individuals the base support may be as low as 0%, an obvious equity issue. It was pointed out that the UCAR university community is also funded at 75% (salary 9 months of 12), so this is perhaps appropriate. This important discussion is ongoing."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Memo,to,Roger,Wakimoto,and,Maura,Hagan,From,NSA,executive,committee,The,following,members,of,the,NSA,EC,were,in,attendance", "filePath": "edu/ucar/ncar/02D7C66F75DA793C94FCF3E60B695A3638735F5646FD4F3962E0E04EA84BC329"}}
