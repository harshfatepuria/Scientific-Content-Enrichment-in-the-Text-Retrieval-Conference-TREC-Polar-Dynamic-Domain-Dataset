This is important because subsurface ice loss affects a significant part of the globally exposed land surface but cannot adequately be characterized by ground temperature measurements alone. The methods developed are intended for routine use in the built and natural environment, and should help to establish baseline data in remote monitoring locations. The principle tool for this will be terrestrial laser scanning, focusing on accuracy over rough or otherwise difficult surfaces (e.g., moss), repeatability, and characterization of vegetation cover. New instruments for this will be acquired in Fall 2014. Suitable complementary methods for scaling (DInSAR, airborne laser scanning) and interpretation (modelling, measuring time series of heave/settlement) will be decided during the first year of the project. Besides method development, this project is expected to result in field measurements providing an accurate insight into the ice loss at selected sites. The ideal candidate is a curious and driven person with strong communication and interpersonal skills. You should be motivated to work in a multidisciplinary environment, and to develop both field measurement and computational analysis. You should have a Masters level degree in a relevant area, e.g., Geodesy, Geomatics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Geography, Engineering, or Earth Sciences. Programming skills and experience with GIS are important assets. You have a very good standard of written and spoken English and are experienced and comfortable in scientific writing. Personal skills and certifications in areas such as wilderness travel or mountaineering are very welcome. == Topic 2: Subsurface properties and permafrost thaw == The expected outcome of this project is a method that allows for efficient measurement of liquid water and ice content in permafrost and in laboratory experiments. This is important as close to 0\u00baC, heat gain in frozen soil is manifested more in changes to its composition than in temperature. As most commercial TDR instruments are difficult to install in boreholes, the principle instrument of this project will employ ring electrodes. The applicability of a prototype field sensor will be tested and its calibration and usability will be supported by laboratory measurements of dielectric properties of frozen soil, and possibly other laboratory measurements and experiments. A corresponding laboratory is in renovation and the required instruments will"}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "PhD,Positions,in,Permafrost,Research", "filePath": "ca/carleton/2734F80430D7F685A73655E67F35A3803048755C963604BD089EE2E85EF41CE7"}}
