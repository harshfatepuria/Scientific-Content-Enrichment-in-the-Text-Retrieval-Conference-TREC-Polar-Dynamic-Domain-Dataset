Some numerical results obtained for various types of vegetation such as grassland, Mediterranean shrubland and pine stand are shown to illustrate the possibility of this system to reproduce some physical phenomena characterizing the behaviour of wildfires (plume dominated and wind driven fires, surface to crown fire transition, etc).
