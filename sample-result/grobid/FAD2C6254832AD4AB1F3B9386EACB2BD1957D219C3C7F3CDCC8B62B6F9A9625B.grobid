As an \" instant university, \" UC Irvine provided the opportunity for the founding faculty to construct the humanities as a space for dialogue between the established disciplines and emerging fields of study. The departments of the School teach critical methods of interpretation and reading of texts (where text can have the broad meaning of document, literary work, visual or cultural representation, and can be delivered in any one of a number of languages.) Our research mission, which feeds graduate teaching directly and undergraduate teaching indirectly, consists in questioning the methods, premises and limits of our disciplines as well as transmitting inherited knowledge and recovering unexamined materials. New fields of study have emerged as a result of questioning the boundaries of the knowledge system and its values. One of the defining characteristics of the School is the School-wide strength in Critical Theory that augments disciplinary reputations and prestige. In formulating our strategic plan, we seek to balance the needs of strong (not necessarily large) departments and to develop the significant School-wide momentum in cross-disciplinary research and curricula. We envision two modes of distributing FTE: continuing the more traditional distribution to departments on the basis of reputation and enrollment, and the successful innovation of supporting School-wide clusters of FTE focused on research and teaching strengths that cross disciplinary boundaries (including School boundaries). Long-term growth in the School is projected to involve 1) moderate growth of the outstanding, large and complex departments; 2) targeted support of several key emerging research and curricular foci across units, including cross school collaboration; 3) maintenance of quality in areas of shrinking enrollments (some of which boast strong, but small graduate programs). The School will continue to monitor the size of the faculty in these areas where some downsizing has already occurred. Additional FTE in categories 1 and 2 will support undergraduate enrollment growth and a small number of new Masters programs and graduate emphases. Assuming average growth rate on the general campus at roughly 20%, the School of Humanities anticipates receiving 39-40 faculty FTE through 2015. Some of this growth will be needed to support the undergraduate growth anticipated to cap in approximately 2010-11. This assumption is based on the need to provide breadth requirements for the general undergraduate population in addition to supporting the needs of the undergraduate majors in Humanities, some of which are growing rapidly. In addition, with its highly ranked departments and programs, the School of Humanities anticipates participating in the campus goal to increase graduate to undergraduate enrollment through strategic growth of our Ph.D. programs and development of a few new Master's programs. More moderate growth would be anticipated beyond 2010-11 as the graduate population continues to grow.
