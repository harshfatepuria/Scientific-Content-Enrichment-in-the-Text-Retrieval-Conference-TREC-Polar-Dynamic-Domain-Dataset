Last year, research was conducted to isolate if a strain of algae had properties able for yielding oil and producing the biofuel. This year, the same strain of algae was tested qualitatively for oil production and the exact species of algae was identified. In addition to considering what other research has been done with the use of fluorescent microscopy and molecular biology techniques such as PCR and DNA sequencing. After the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), the PCR product was sent for sequencing at Clemson University. Once the DNA sequencing results came back, an NCBI BLAST was conducted. The results of the BLAST pointed towards the green algae named Sphaeropleales sp. However, the expected value was 10-125 meaning that the chance of this match happening at random was less than 10-125. The algae, Sphaeropleales sp. is local to southern Colorado, has a potential for producing biofuel, and correct information for scale up. The non-renewable sources (petroleum) of fuel for transportation are being used up; renewable sources will become more valuable. One renewable resource for transportation fuels that can easily be put into current modes of transportation is algae. This research may identify a strain of Algae that might provide one future source of these fuels."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Mitchell,Fosdick,Phase,II,Identification,of,Isolates,of,Algae,with,Biofuel,Properties", "filePath": "edu/colostate/csef/www/52466C3DFA4CFDAF21B7A90EBD4227B9D2907D7D589B2CB088D95498137A8022"}}
