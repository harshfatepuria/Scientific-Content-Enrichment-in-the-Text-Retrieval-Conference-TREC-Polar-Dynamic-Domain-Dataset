After a brief review of the important physical processes thought to be responsible for tornadogenesis, I will describe why we use mobile Doppler radars to study tornadoes and discuss the successes and failures of the field operations involving the three radars my graduate students, collaborators, and I used."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Advanced,Study,Program,Seminar,Mobile,Doppler,Radar,Operations,During,VORTEX2,Year,1,Better,Living,Through,Radiation", "filePath": "edu/ucar/asp/www/DCA30DB56CC4A9E56B4AE3CBAD11D717E3B4ABF2058D2F1D95DB19D0A9322DCA"}}
