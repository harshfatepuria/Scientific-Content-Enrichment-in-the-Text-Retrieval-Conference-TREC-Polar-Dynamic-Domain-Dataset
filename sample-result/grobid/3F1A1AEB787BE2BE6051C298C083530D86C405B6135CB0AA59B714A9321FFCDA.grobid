These foundations are separately incorporated entities with an independent board of trustees, and are organized as charities under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. \u2022 In recent years, almost half of all the private support raised by the University of California-and over 80% of all gifts to establish endowments-has been given through the Campus Foundations. \u2022 As shown in the figure below, for each of the past five years, over $500 million has been gifted to the UC"}}, "revisionDesc": {"date": {"type": "submission", "when": 1999}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "UC,Campus,Foundations,Frequently,Asked,Questions,WHAT,ARE,THE,UC,CAMPUS,FOUNDATIONS,AND,HOW,DOES,UC,OVERSEE,THEIR,OPERATIONS", "filePath": "edu/ucop/3F1A1AEB787BE2BE6051C298C083530D86C405B6135CB0AA59B714A9321FFCDA"}}
