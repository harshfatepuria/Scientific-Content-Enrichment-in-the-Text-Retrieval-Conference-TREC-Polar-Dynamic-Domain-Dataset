As such, FPS is like a small, specialized business within the University whose primary activity is the distribution of plant material and provision of testing services to commercial nurseries. FPS does not conduct research or maintain performance or evaluative information about the materials in its collection, and does not make horticultural recommendations. Please consult the resources identified on the Web site for each crop area for information and advice in these areas. FPS is set up mainly to provide small quantities of elite propagating material to nurseries, who then increase materials to commercial quantities. We do not maintain, and are not generally able to supply, very large numbers of cuttings, plants or seed. It is normally necessary to purchase from a commercial nursery if you are looking for very large quantities of propagating material. Also, FPS generally collects and distributes only propagating material for which formal orders have been submitted, and does not maintain a standing inventory of materials available for \"off the shelf\" purchase. For some materials like mist propagated grape plants, particularly for new selections and varieties that are in short supply, there can be a significant wait to receive materials. As part of the planning for your planting, it is important to investigate the lead time required to receive the materials you desire. All materials maintained in the FPS collection have passed carefully selected tests for specific target virus diseases. Foundation-level (or \"registered\") materials are tested in accordance with the indexing tests and technologies prescribed in California Department of Food & Agriculture registration and certification program regulations. All foundation-level materials have tested negative on CDFA-prescribed tests. Prices Because of the high cost of maintaining a specialized collection of premium disease-tested materials, you will notice that prices for FPS material are higher than material that can be obtained from commercial nurseries. Minimum order charges are set for each crop to enable FPS to recover base-level administrative and processing costs which are incurred even for very small orders. Because our program is supported primarily by the California nursery industry and supplemented in some measure by the University of California, some costs will be higher for material going out of state, and significant surcharges or minimum order charges apply to most orders going to customers outside the U.S."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Information,for,New,FPS,Customers", "filePath": "edu/ucdavis/fpms/7AE81528D7597E435ECB2C1BC04950129CD96820FC2A7451E983ABF23014A3DD"}}
