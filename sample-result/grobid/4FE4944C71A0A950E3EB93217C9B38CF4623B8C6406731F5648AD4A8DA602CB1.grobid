I beach-combed bark and driftwood from shore and stored it in bins in the engine compartment. The stove emitted a cheery crackle and the stack a pleasant woody aroma when the stove was fired up, and since the entire living space was only about 20 square feet, it put out plenty of heat. But the firebox was so small that the thing would go out in less than an hour if it wasn't continually stoked, and debris from the wood bins choked my bilge pump. Plus I had to take a trip to shore every couple of nights to search for fuel. When I finally pitched the old Washington and installed a used bulkhead-mounted oil burner, I entered the lap of luxury. That early experience highlighted the key characteristics of a good boat heating system: \u2022 Keeps the interior living spaces warm and dry \u2022 Is simple to operate, reliable, and relatively trouble-free \u2022 Is compatible with the other systems in the boat \u2022 Is economical to buy, install, and operate \u2022 Is safe to use in the harsh working environment of a boat."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "BOATKEEPER,Boat,Heat,From,Pacific,Fishing", "filePath": "edu/uaf/seagrant/4FE4944C71A0A950E3EB93217C9B38CF4623B8C6406731F5648AD4A8DA602CB1"}}
