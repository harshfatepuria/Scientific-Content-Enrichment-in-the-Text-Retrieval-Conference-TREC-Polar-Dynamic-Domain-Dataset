One source of the currents is the dynamo effect generated by thermospheric winds that move the conducting medium through the geomagnetic field. Observations of the geomagnetic perturbations produced by the ionospheric currents, and of the polarization electric fields associated with the currents, provide information about the wind system, including atmospheric tides that propagate up from lower altitudes. At high latitudes, interactions with the magnetosphere dominate ionospheric electrodynamics, and supply major sources of momentum and heat to the thermosphere. During magnetic storms the magnetospheric energy input can disturb the thermosphere and ionosphere globally."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Advanced,Study,Program,Seminar,at,11,am,Center,Green,Laboratory1,South,Auditorium,Refreshments,served,before,the,seminar", "filePath": "edu/ucar/asp/www/2C13DB675DC61E64C13680129ECBC2F7F255007754AB6C4AF98B68E50648BF29"}}
