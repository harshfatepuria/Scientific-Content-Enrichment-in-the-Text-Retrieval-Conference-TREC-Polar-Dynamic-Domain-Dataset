If the new estimate is accurate, the current magnitude of human alteration of the terrestrial N cycle has been understated. At the same time, anthropogenic fixation of N is accelerating in rapidly developing economies \u2013 most notably China, which now uses 50% more N fertilizer than the US and the EU combined. Several Chinese research groups are working to develop ways to reduce the N-intensity of intensive agricultural production in China and other rapidly developing economies. Finding ways to increase yields on a static land base while reducing levels of environmental damage that are already devastating represents a compelling scientific challenge and would be a substantial contribution to human well-being."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "NCAR,Advanced,Study,Program,Thompson,Lecture,Series,Perspectives,on,the,Nitrogen,Cycle", "filePath": "edu/ucar/asp/www/738785ECE30689A29829F5E4A374B0B7E59C4821C6CAA74FD614CBC91248DD86"}}
