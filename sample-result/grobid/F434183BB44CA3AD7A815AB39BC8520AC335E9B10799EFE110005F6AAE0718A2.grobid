Campus leadership works closely with the campus police department and units across campus to identify problematic situations and mitigate them before they become more serious. Several campus committees work regularly on school and workplace violence issues and police officers receive extensive training that includes scenarios involving active shooter situations. Many campus safety programs and resources are available to students, faculty and staff. Information on safety at UCI and links to other campus services is available on the UCIPD Website at www.police.uci.edu. Members of the campus community are encouraged to make use of the many resources available to them. Most importantly, if you see a person carrying a firearm on campus call 9-1-1 from any telephone or cell phone. In most circumstances these calls are routed directly to the UC Irvine Police Dispatch Center.
