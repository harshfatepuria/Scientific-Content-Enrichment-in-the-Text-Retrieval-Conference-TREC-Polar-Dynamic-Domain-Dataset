The S-Pol radar transmits and receives both horizontal and vertical polarized waves providing information about the mean axis ratio of measured hydrometeors, the presence of mixed phase (liquid and ice) or melting conditions, and the presence radar contaminants including ground clutter, insects, birds etc. The EOL has continued to upgrade the capabilities of the S-Pol system and recently added a second 0.86 cm wavelength (K a-band) radar that measures the same volume at the same time as the S-band radar (referred to as S-PolKa). The resulting dual-wavelength radar measurements provide the opportunity to utilize the differential attenuation of the two wavelengths to estimate quantities not otherwise available including humidity profiles and total cloud liquid water content. Over its lifetime the S-Pol radar has been deployed around the world to study numerous cloud and precipitation systems at a variety of scales from torrential monsoon rains in Mexico to trade wind cumulus in the Caribbean and most recently the interaction between cloud and precipitation processes and the large scale Madden Julian Oscillation. This talk will provide an overview of the S-PolKa facility, what it measures and the science that it enables."}, "textClass": {"keywords": {"term": ["am", "Foothills Laboratory, Building 2, Large Auditorium", "Refreshments served before the seminar"]}}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Advanced,Study,Program,Seminar,The,NCAR,Sband,Dualpolarimetric,Dualwavelength,SPolKa,Radar,A,Unique,Radar,Platform,Serving,the,Science,Community", "filePath": "edu/ucar/asp/www/C8B722265DC0AE294CFA8BBBD4E08E0D186D61F39169A88A7D22DC0CF9BFC0F3"}}
