Temperature of the CPT (T-CPT) demonstrates distinct local minima in tropics where strong convections prevail and shows a strong seasonality. Regardless of longitudinal location, the tropical CPT is colder during boreal winter compared to that in boreal summer. This seasonality is associated with both circulation in the stratosphere and upwelling in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) as evident from the same phase of seasonal cycle of temperature in the lower-stratosphere. The seasonal cycle in the T-CPT is strongest over the western Pacific warm pool sector but weakest over the east-central Pacific, where the upward and downward branch of the Walker circulation exists, respectively. This locality of seasonal cycle is connected with tropospheric processes such as convection and associated large-scale circulation. This also indicates that tropospheric processes modulate localities of the CPT. The intraseasonal variability of the T-CPT shows the signature of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and Kelvin wave. These intraseasonal variabilities are reasonably well matched to convective activities, which is presented with outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR), in the tropics, however, the Kelvin wave signature is related to both convectively driven and free Kelvin waves in the UTLS."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Tropical,ColdPoint,Tropopause,Climatology,Seasonal,Cycle,and,Intraseasonal,Variability,Derived,from,COSMIC,GPS,RO,Measurements", "filePath": "edu/ucar/cosmic/www/C7C9B79A7DF09F992AA62B6AD3534111C4C15D313CB47ED1C799B0393495FBC9"}}
