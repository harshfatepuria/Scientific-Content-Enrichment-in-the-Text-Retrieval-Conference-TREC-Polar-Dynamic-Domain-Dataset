Our purpose was to study (1) what kind of North-South asymmetry is produced in solar cycle pattern when the Babcock-Leighton poloidal source is asymmetric in North and South and (2) what kind of North-South asymmetry is produced in solar cycle pattern when we introduce different meridional flow in the North and South. We specifically incorporate (A) one cell in the northern hemisphere and two cells stacked in latitude in the southern hemisphere, (B) one cell in North and two cells stacked in depth in South, (C) one cell in North and four cells in South, (D) two cell in latitude in North and four cells in the South. In the (1) case we find from our simulations that the dynamos in North and South operate independently with weak coupling. In the (2) case, we find also that the dynamos in the northern and southern hemispheres operate pretty much independently and in the cases of two cells in depth and four cells, the dynamo cycle lenth increases and the buttefly mostly poleward except very low latitude. In the other hand, in the case of two cells in latitude the cycle length decreases and primarly equatorward butterfly is obtain except the very high latitude. Therefore, N-S asymmetry in meridional circulation produces phase lag or lead between solar cycles in two hemispheres."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "The,National,Center,for,Atmospheric,HAO,Colloquium,Series,Refreshments,served,Title,Investigation,of,the,NorthSouth,Asymmetry,with,a,Flux,Transport,Dynamo", "filePath": "edu/ucar/hao/www/3A46CBC8E30F367AD769764AACF767B6E186BFB574A734256BE90E699BF58A72"}}
