The effects of the multi-scale organization of convection on large-scale circulation are poorly understood. The talk will demonstrate the application of a cloud-resolving model (CRM) to meso-scale organization of convection in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and to the problem of tropical cyclogenesis. The application of a Multi-scale Modeling Framework (MMF) to large-scale organization of convection such as the MJO is also discussed."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "CISL,SEMINAR,SERIES,Presents,Multiscale,modeling,of,clouds,and,process,studies,using,CRM,and,MMF,frameworks,Date,Time,and,Location,100PM,200PM,NCAR,Mesa,Lab,Main,Seminar,Room,Light,refreshments,served,immediately,following,the,presentation", "filePath": "edu/ucar/cisl/www/8A17192307B21FB0353CC812BBF973CC218A4A2E1EE37CE2BF9DD93C75FF8370"}}
