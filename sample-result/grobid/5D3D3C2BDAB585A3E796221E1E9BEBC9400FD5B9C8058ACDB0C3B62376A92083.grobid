Following the recent paper by Gaume and Borga (2008) that provides detailed guidelines for postflood field investigations we ask: 'What is the status of current flash flood observation capabilities and what are some specific strategies to expand our databases?' For several reasons scientific understanding of flash flood impacts is limited. Short lead times, localized areas of impact, and confusion over what events are defined as flash floods (debris flows, landslides, intense posthurricane rain-falls, river response o 6 h from intense rainfall), our flash flood knowledge is primarily based on detailed postevent investigations to estimate flood magnitude, timing, and sediment transfer. Case studies improve our scientific understanding of rainfall\u2013runoff processes, but are limited in scope to the specificity of the extreme magnitude of the events, the geomorphology of the region impacted, and antecedent conditions of the atmosphere, land surface, streams, soils, and underlying aquifers. Much remains to be known about the spatial extent, frequency, and magnitude, i.e. climatology, of flash floods. Maddox et al. summed up the state of flash flood climatolo-gies in 1979 and his words still apply: 'Unfortunately, reports of flash floods are often vague, many flash flood events are probably never reported, and there is no national [US] database for collecting flash flood reports'. A statistical understanding of flash flood frequencies can be used to improve the skill of prediction models. Moreover, we need to know the state of flash flood climatologies in today's world to anticipate the societal impacts of flash floods in future scenarios of climatic, demographic, and land use changes. What kind of data can be used to derive flash flood climatology maps? Flood hydrograph reconstruction is possible through field investigations ex post facto as discussed by Gaume and Borga and also with instruments that report in real time, situated in or near streams and onboard satellites. In situ stream velocity and stage measurements have the benefits of providing a quantitative metric of stream discharge, are taken at high temporal resolution, i.e. on the order of minutes, and as such can be used to compute flash flood frequency statistics. These instruments are rather limited in their spatial coverage and they require regular maintenance, support, and a means to communicate or store their data. More cost-effective methods of measuring stream discharge through remote sensing include acoustic Doppler profilers. The use of these instruments for field studies has been demonstrated, and their deployment in operational networks will improve the spatial density of discharge measurements at the flash flood scale. In the last decade, remote sensing of surface water has been demonstrated through satellite-based retrievals. Observations are available with a spatial resolution on the order of tens of kilometers with a near-daily frequency, depending on cloud conditions. The major advantages of space-borne water surface area detection is the possibility for global coverage, data formatting is standard, and there is real-time data access without regard to political boundaries. The utility of space-borne measurement of floods will certainly increase with future missions and better spatio-temporal resolution, but for the time being, the near-daily satellite passes is insufficient for estimating peak flows associated with flash floods."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Journal,of,Flood,Risk,Management", "filePath": "com/evegruntfest/www/5D3D3C2BDAB585A3E796221E1E9BEBC9400FD5B9C8058ACDB0C3B62376A92083"}}
