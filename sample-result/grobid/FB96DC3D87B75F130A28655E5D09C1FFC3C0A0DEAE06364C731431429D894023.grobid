Candidates must be able to teach material from earlier periods. UCSC is the only northern California campus of the University of California with a major and minor in Jewish Studies. The successful candidate will be appointed as a faculty member of one of the departments in the Humanities Division. Core faculty members in the UCSC Program in Jewish Studies are responsible for teaching throughout our curriculum, including materials from biblical and post-biblical eras and writings, and are expected to participate in the activities of the Center for Jewish Studies on campus. We seek scholars with demonstrated teaching excellence, and with evidence of a developed research trajectory. Candidates will be expected to teach a range of large undergraduate lecture courses, as well as smaller courses and seminars, and to contribute significantly to graduate education and the mentoring of graduate students. We are particularly interested in candidates with administrative skill and leadership potential within Jewish Studies at the university.
