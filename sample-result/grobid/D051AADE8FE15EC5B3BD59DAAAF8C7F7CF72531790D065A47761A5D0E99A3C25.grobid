Our approach is to develop and apply novel spatiotemporal data mining techniques to multiple severe weather applications. In this talk, I will introduce three spatiotemporal data mining methods that my group has developed: the Spatiotemporal Relational Probability Tree, the Spatiotemporal Relational Random Forest, and Ensembles of Continuous Bayesian Networks.
