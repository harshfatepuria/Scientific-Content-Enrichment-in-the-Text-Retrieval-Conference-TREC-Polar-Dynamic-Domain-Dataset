Smithsonian research and collections provide the foundation for the extraordinary presentation that unfolds in the Sant Ocean Hall. Throughout the hall, in every exhibit, the work of Smithsonian scientists is on display. Exploration: Although the ocean represents some 95 percent of Earth's living space, exploring the sunless depths of the ocean is fraught with almost as many challenges as exploring outer space. As a result, only about 5 percent of the ocean has been adequately studied. Only through the use of specially designed research diving vessels like Alvin can scientists explore the deep ocean and its remarkably varied animal and microbial life. The Census of Marine Life represents a ten-year effort to catalogue the enormous diversity of life in the ocean. Seventeen research projects are investigating six ocean realms that will be reported in the first Census of Marine Life in October 2010. Support for the Census of Marine Life comes from various government agencies concerned with environment, fisheries, and science in a growing list of nations as well as from private foundations and companies. Collections: Much of what we know about the diversity and evolution of life in the ocean is based on collections of specimens. These specimens provide the principal source of information on the tremendous variety of life in the ocean. Museums house and preserve these and many other collections and make them accessible for research, exhibits, and education."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Fact,Sheet,Marine,Science,in,the,Sant,Ocean,Hall", "filePath": "edu/si/mnh/www/EF08D4AFD0E43C4B21ADB391D176B63BA0115B881DCF193B4A12C076C3BC4726"}}
