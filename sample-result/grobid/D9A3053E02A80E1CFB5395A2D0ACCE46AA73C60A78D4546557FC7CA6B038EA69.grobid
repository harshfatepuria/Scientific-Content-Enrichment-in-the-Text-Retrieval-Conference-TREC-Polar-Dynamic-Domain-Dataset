This is the third year of the project in cooperation with the Forest Service. Baseline vegetation and stream health data at two locations, the Bird Draw (Dom 1) and Upper Dominguez (Dom 2) allotments on Big Dominguez Creek from 2011 through 2013 were compared. Short-term indicators, vegetation stubble height, stream bank alteration and woody species use and long-term indicators stubble height, stream bank stability, woody species use, green line composition, substrate, pool depth/frequency, woody species height class, woody species age class, and woody species use class (green line vegetation ecological status) were used to evaluate a short-duration, high intensity grazing system. Results from 2013 indicate grazing can negatively affect riparian area health when cattle are allowed to graze outside of the prescribed grazing period or when the amount of use exceeds Forest Service grazing standards. The green line vegetation ecological status score at Dom 1 declined from 75 in spring 2011 to 64 in spring 2013 while scores on Dom 2 were consistent between years. Grazing on Dom 2 was closer to the prescribed levels (standards and duration), while Dom 1 grazing was above the prescribed levels. Data shows the green line ecological status at Dom 1 is being negatively impacted from livestock grazing. Vegetation on Dom 2 remained stable but did not improve, demonstrating that grazing livestock for the prescribed time and season, and meeting standards are needed to improve riparian vegetation."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Sarah,Stalcup,Riparian,Area,Multiple,Indicator,Monitoring", "filePath": "edu/colostate/csef/www/D9A3053E02A80E1CFB5395A2D0ACCE46AA73C60A78D4546557FC7CA6B038EA69"}}
