Relevance and Application: \u2022 Incremental strides have been made in improving the efficiency of different forms of energy production and consumption. For example, today's engines are much more efficient than those from 50 years ago, and batteries are more powerful and last longer than those from just a few years ago."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Grade,Level,Expectation,High,School", "filePath": "edu/colorado/learnmoreaboutclimate/B6E811A84748A3F034E1CCC9B921B2D323712DE1CE813255EED21E45488113B3"}}
