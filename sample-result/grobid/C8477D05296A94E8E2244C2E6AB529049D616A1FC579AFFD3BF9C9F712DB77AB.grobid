To support its instrument partners it provides extensive tools for development. Aside from simplifying some aspects of instrument development for its partners, this approach provides advantages for ATST itself as it allows to fully integrate and maintain first-light and future ATST instrumentation. At the same time it reduces cost by supplying those subsystems that are common to all instruments, such as cameras and data transport and storage. The Visible Broadband Imager is one of several ATST first-light instruments, and is in many aspects a frontrunner for the ATST instrument development and integration. It will deliver diffraction-limited, reconstructed 'broadband' images in various regions of the solar photosphere and chromosphere at high cadence, allowing the investigation of dynamic small-scale solar features. After a brief overview of the current status of ATST's construction, some of the key features of several ATST support subsystems will be presented at the example of the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI). In the case of the VBI, this includes among others in particular the ATST Data Handling System that will allow real-time image reconstruction, and the ATST Wavefront Correction System that will provide necessary input data quality and auxilliary data for the reconstruction algorithms."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "The,National,Center,for,Atmospheric,HAO,Colloquium,Series,Speaker,Title,Integrating,the,Visible,Broadband,Imager,into,the,Advanced,Technology,Solar,Telescope,infrastructure", "filePath": "edu/ucar/hao/www/C8477D05296A94E8E2244C2E6AB529049D616A1FC579AFFD3BF9C9F712DB77AB"}}
