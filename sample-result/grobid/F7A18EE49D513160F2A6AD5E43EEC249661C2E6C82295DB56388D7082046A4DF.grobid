We aimed to begin the program by entraining two graduate student/faculty advisor pairs, and had verbal agreements with two Howard University faculty members. However, actively engaging the Howard faculty into this activity was more difficult than we had anticipated, and in the end we only succeeded with one student/advisor pair. Mary Barth (NESL/ACD) worked together with Prof. William Stockwell (Howard U. faculty) on advising Tamil Maldonado over the last two years. Brief summary of Tamil Maldonado's research activities Tamil has visited NCAR/ACD twice over the past two years. For Tamil's Ph.D. thesis, her plan was to study aerosol-cloud interactions using the WRF-Chem model applied to observations from the BEACHON field experiment. Tamil visited NESL/ACD during July-October, 2011, focusing on becoming familiar with the BEACHON project and learning how to run and modify WRF-Chem. These goals were readily achieved. By the time she left NCAR at the end of October, Tamil had successfully run the WRF-Chem model, had visited the BEACHON field site and became more familiar with the project via presentations and discussions, and learned how to use a chemistry model that solves both gas-phase and aqueous-phase chemistry."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Final,Report,for,FY10,NCAR,Directorate,Diversity,Fund,Title,Building,LongTerm,University,Partnerships", "filePath": "edu/ucar/ncar/F7A18EE49D513160F2A6AD5E43EEC249661C2E6C82295DB56388D7082046A4DF"}}
