The two aircraft in the fleet operate under very different rules. The C-130 has been, and will continue to be, operated in the \" public \" category. That means that payloads can be assessed and approved for use \" in-house \" without consultation with the FAA-the primary criteria being compatibility with existing infrastructure and compliance with established safety concerns. Mid-project changes can be freely made at the facility's discretion by applying the same process. While the G-V is technically a \" public \" aircraft, the NSF has directed the RAF to maintain the aircraft under a Standard Airworthiness Certificate. After first passing an RAF review, each payload must pass through an FAA certification process that requires very detailed documentation. This process typically takes a minimum of one month to complete, resulting in a payload that cannot undergo a \" major \" modification (ie external configuration change; increase in payload weight; or increase in power consumption) without going back to the FAA for approval. The biggest impact the recent changes have had on the NSF and OFAP review processes is related to the development, delivery, and deployment of new instruments on the two aircraft. New instruments still under development are being included in requested research payloads. Field deployments have very specific deadlines and it is difficult to fully assess the airworthiness, functionality, and availability of these systems on such a time line. These new procedures will establish clear guidelines on how this issue will be handled in the feasibility review process. The deployment schedule for each approved field project includes a very specific and limited upload interval when the entire research instrumentation payload must be installed on the aircraft. Due to various scheduling constraints only a minimal amount of pre-deployment flight testing is allotted to ready the payload for the actual deployment into the field. The new procedures will ensure that all systems included in a research payload will be ready to meet the upload and deployment schedules established for that project. A key component of the new process will be the inclusion of annual flight test programs into the RAF schedule. These programs will be open opportunities for instrument developers to flight test their new systems without the pressure of an imminent field deployment while providing the RAF with the opportunity of evaluating and certifying each system as a routine task. The flight test programs will be"}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "C130,Investigators,Handbook,Chapter,8,New,Feasibility,Instrumentation,Integration,Procedures,81,Instrument,Certification,and,Approval", "filePath": "edu/ucar/eol/www/9602D2BE403173FF83E14E322AC419C7C52231B6601388F0EE1D76669D037976"}}
