The observed scales appear to originate with the advective interaction of downflow plumes in the solar radiative boundary layer. Such motions are critical not only to turbulent heat transport but also to the operation of the solar magnetic dynamo, by determining the effective horizontal diffusion of magnetic elements in the Sun's surface layers. This talk focusses on two simple n-body dynamical models, one of point sinks and the other of point vortices, and how they might inform solar observations and laboratory measurements."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Advanced,Study,Program,Seminar,Turbulent,scale,selection,and,transport,in,the,solar,photosphere", "filePath": "edu/ucar/asp/www/2FAE6F3CB1C67E1DD08A34E1428CE4B3F6A8BCE40E3BE9E8F18B85FA1A52935A"}}
