Public records maintained by the University of California are available for public access according to the following procedures: b. Requests for inspection or copying of public records: 1. Requesters should provide specific information about the records they seek. When a record cannot be identified by name, the requester should attempt to be as specific as possible in describing the record, based on its content. If known, requesters should indicate the office, campus, or the department that created and maintains the records. 2. Can be made orally or in writing, but UC strongly encourages written requests (including via email). UC may confirm oral requests in writing to ensure it has correctly understood the request. c. UC may refuse to disclose any records or portions of records which are exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act. (See Gov. Code \u00a7 6254 et seq.) d. Copies of records that are not exempt from disclosure are available upon pre-payment of the copying costs (20 cents per page). e. If a requester wishes to inspect the records instead of (or in advance of) requesting copies of the records to be made, such inspection of records will be allowed upon reasonable conditions determined by UC. Records are available for inspection during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. Upon either the completion of the inspection or the oral request of UC personnel, the person conducting the inspection shall relinquish physical possession of the records. Persons inspecting UC records shall not destroy, mutilate, deface, alter, or remove any such records from UC. UC reserves the right to have UC personnel present during the inspection of records in order to prevent the loss or destruction of records. The operational functions of UC will not be suspended to permit inspection of records during periods in which such records are reasonably required by UC personnel in the performance of their duties. If the request requires review of numerous records, a mutually agreeable time should be established for the inspection of the records."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Guidelines,for,Access,to,UCOP,Public,Records", "filePath": "edu/ucop/www/086B9C3C5B4B582A26CDBA7E04865056B231C662B3AEC3C8BE86C6538589F317"}}
