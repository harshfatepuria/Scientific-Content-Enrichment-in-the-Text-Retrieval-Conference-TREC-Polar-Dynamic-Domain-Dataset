Values of albedo-change \u2206A and droplet number concentration N d were calculated for a wide range of values of m s , \u2206N d , updraught speed W, cloud-thickness \u2206Z and cloud-base temperature T B : for three measured aerosol spectra, corresponding to ambient air of negligible, moderate and high levels of pollution. Our choices of parameter-value ranges were determined by the extent of their applicability to the mitigation scheme, whose current formulation is still somewhat preliminary, thus rendering unwarranted in this study the utilisation of refinements incorporated into some other stratocumulus models. In agreement with earlier studies: (1), \u2206A was found to be very sensitive to \u2206N and (within certain constraints) insensitive to changes in m s , W, \u2206Z and T B ; (2), the magnitude of \u2206A was greatest for clouds formed in pure air, and least for highly polluted air. In many situations considered to be within the ambit of the mitigation scheme, the calculated \u2206A values exceeded those estimated by earlier workers as being necessary to produce a cooling sufficient to compensate, globally, for the warming resulting from a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. These calculations, coupled with simple computations made with a Hadley Center (UK) GCM, provide quantitative support for the physical viability of the mitigation scheme, and offer new insights into its technological requirements. Questions are outlined regarding the meteorological ramifications of this mitigation scheme, and its current technological status is discussed."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "Assessment,of,a,Proposed,Technique,for,Global,Warming,Mitigation,via,AlbedoEnhancement,of,Marine,Stratocumulus,Clouds", "filePath": "edu/ucar/asp/www/4DFFE41DB656D1AEF4AB8E9A84E7A1CA3C9D61E5B7FB975491B320D9A277BDE6"}}
