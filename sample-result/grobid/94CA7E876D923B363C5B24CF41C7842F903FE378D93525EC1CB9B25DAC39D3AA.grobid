Prey distributions were found to vary spatially and seasonally between 2001 and 2007. Pelagic fish distribution was correlated to the presence of oceanographic features on the northeast side of Kodiak Island and surveys were expanded to accommodate these features. Specifically, horizontal features of the water column off Portlock Bank, Marmot Gully and Chiniak Gully appear to affect the distributions of capelin and walleye pollock."}}, "xml:lang": "en"}, "text": {"xml:lang": "en"}, "xmlns": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0", "xmlns:xlink": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "xsi:schemaLocation": "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 /Users/harshfatepuria/Desktop/599/HW2/grobid/grobid-home/schemas/xsd/Grobid.xsd"}, "extractedTitle": "GAP,Monitoring,spatial,and,temporal,patterns,in,the,distribution,and,abundance,of,prey,species,in,Kodiak,waters", "filePath": "edu/uaf/seagrant/94CA7E876D923B363C5B24CF41C7842F903FE378D93525EC1CB9B25DAC39D3AA"}}
